# Content Service

Our vision of a decentralized platform can't rely on a single centralized server storing an only copy of the virtual world's content. The Content Service allows anyone to host their own instance of the server that stores the world data, guaranteeing its availability. By having multiple servers distributed around the world that replicate the data, we can also ensure the content will have fast download speeds, independently of the location.

The content hosted in each server includes all the files that make up Decentraland scenes, including .ts scripts, 3D models, texture images, audio files and videos. Currently, each server stores the entirety of the data of all of Genesis city. In future releases of the content service, you'll be able to host a server that only holds the data for specific parcels, to ensure that your scene is always available without depending on any third party.

When a user is near a parcel, the Decentraland client checks the blockchain to know what content exists there. The LAND token for that parcel includes a reference that indirectly points to a chunk of content in the content server, which the client downloads to display in place.


## Requirements

The following dependencies need to be installed to run a content service server.

- [Go 1.11](https://golang.org/dl/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Setup Environment 

```
$ make init
```

## Configuration

To configure the service, edit the `config.yml` file, in the base directory. It has the following default content:

```
server:
  port: '8000'                  # port to use for server
  url: 'http://localhost:8000'  # server URL (used in the replication script)

s3Storage:
  bucket: ''        # Bucket to use in S3
  acl: ''           # ACL for the bucket and files
  url: ''           # URL for the bucket

localStorage: 'tmp'   # local storage dir

redis:
 address: 'content_service_redis:6379'    # address of the redis server
 password: ''                             # password
 DB: 0
```

**Note**: If you use `s3Storage` you need to set AWS environment variables: `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_SECRET_KEY`.

## Running

First start Redis:

```
$ make ops
```

Then build the project:

```
$ make build
```

You can instead build and run with a single command:

```
$ make run
```

`make run` starts an instance of the content service server.

## Endpoints

### POST /mappings

This endpoint recieves a request with a `Content-Type:multipart/form-data` query parameter, and with the following parts:

- Metadata: is named `metadata` and has a JSON:

```
{
  "value": <root CID>,
  "signature": <signed root CID>,
  "pubKey": <eth address>,
  "validityType": <int>,
  "validity": <timestamp>,
  "sequence": <int>
}
```

- Content: is named `<root CID>` and has a JSON:

```
[
  {"cid": <file CID>, "name": <file path>},
  ...
]
```

- Files: the rest of the parts correspond to the uploaded files, they will be named `<file CID>` and have the `filename` header set to file's name.

### GET /mappings

This endpoint gets all the scenes from an area delimited by a northwest coordinate and a southeast coordinate. It expects the following query paramaters:

- `nw="-13,45"`
- `se="13,-45"`

It returns a JSON as follows:

```
[
  {
    "parcel_id: "-13,45"
    "contents": {
      <file1>: <file1 CID>,
      <file2>: <file2 CID>,
      ...
    }
  },
  ...
]
```

### GET /validate

This endpoint fetches the metadata from a parcel. It expects the following query paramaters:

- `x=-13`
- `y=16"`

It returns a JSON as follows:

```
{
  "value": <root CID>,
  "signature": <signed root CID>,
  "pubKey": <eth address>,
  "validityType": <int>,
  "validity": <timestamp>,
  "sequence": <int>,
  "root_cid": <root CID>
}
```

### GET /contents/{CID}

This endpoint gets a file by its `CID`.

## Examples

In the following examples we use the data generated by the `demo.sh` script and a local server.

```bash

## Replication

To replicate a `content-service` server run:

```
$ make replicate
```

You will recieve a prompt to input the map coordinates for the NW and SE parcels.

This program connects to the server url provided in `config.yml`. It stores the data files in the dir specified by `localstorage` and populates the Redis instance defined in the `redis` field.
